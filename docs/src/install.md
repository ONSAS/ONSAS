## Visualizing results

You can process the outputs using Octave, however, the open-source software [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) can be used to visualize the results produced by ONSAS.

## Generation of geometries/meshes

The user can provide the geometry of the structure using two optional formats: .msh or .dxf.  [GMSH](https://gmsh.info/) is an open-source tool that allows to generate high-quality meshes. The dxf files can be used using any CAD tool.
