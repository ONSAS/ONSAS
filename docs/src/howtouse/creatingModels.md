# Creating structural models

The data and properties of each structural model are defined through a set of definitions in a .m script. These properties are stored in [struct](https://octave.org/doc/v5.2.0/Structures.html#Structures) data structures. The following structs must be defined and provided as input to the ONSAS function in this order:

 1. `materials`
 1. `elements`
 1. `boundaryConds`
 1. `initialConds`
 1. `mesh`
 1. `numericalMethod`
 1. `otherParams`

Each struct has its own _fields_ with specific names, used to store each corresponding property or information. Each field is obtained or assigned using _structName.fieldName_. A description of each struct and its fields follows at next.

## The `materials` struct

The materials struct contains the information of the material behavior considered for each element.

### `material.hyperElasModel`

This is a cell array with the string-names of the material models used, the options for these names are:
 * `'linearElastic'`: for linear behavior in small strains and displacements. The scalar parameters of this model are $p_1=E$ the Young modulus and $p_2=\nu$ the Poisson's ratio.
 * `'SVK'`: for a Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff material where the parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the Lam√© parameters and $\textbf{E}$ is the Green-Lagrange strain tensor, with the strain-energy density function given by
```math
\Psi( \textbf{E} ) = \frac{p_1}{2} tr(\textbf{E})^2 + p_2 tr(\textbf{E}^2)
\quad
p_1 = \frac{ E \nu }{ (1+\nu) (1-2\nu) }
\quad
p_2 = \frac{ E }{ 2 (1+\nu) }
```
 * `'NHC'`: for a Neo-Hookean compressible material. The model implemented is given by
```math
\Psi( \textbf{C} ) = \frac{p_1}{2} ( tr(\textbf{C})-3 -2 L( \sqrt{det(\textbf{C})} ) ) + \frac{p_2}{2} \left( \sqrt{det(\textbf{C})}-1 \right)^2
 \quad
 p_1 = \frac{ E }{ 2 (1+\nu) }
 \quad
 p_2 = \frac{ E }{ 3 (1-2 \nu) }
```
 * `'isotropicHardening'`:  $p_1=E$ , $p_2 = K$ and $p_3=\sigma_{Y,0}$.

### `materials.hyperElasParams`
A cell structure with vectors with the material properties of each material used in the model. The $i$-th entry of the cell, contains a vector like this:
```math
[ p_1 \dots p_{n_P} ]
```
where $n_P$ is the number of parameters of the constitutive model and $\mathbf{p}$ is the vector of constitutive parameters.

### `material.density`

This is a cell with the scalar values of the densities of the materials used in the model.

### `material.nodalMass`

This fields sets a vector of nodal masses components $[m_x, m_y, m_z]$ that is assigned to nodes.

## The `elements` struct

The elements struct contains the information about the type of finite elements used and their corresponding parameters.

### `elements.elemType`
cell structure with the string-names of the elements used: `node`, `truss`, `frame`, `triangle` or `tetrahedron`. Other auxiliar types such as `edge` are also available

### `elements.elemTypeParams`
cell structure with auxiliar params information, required for some element types:

 * `triangle` vector with parameters, the first parameter is an integer indicating if plane stress (1) or plane strain (2) case is considered.
### `elements.massMatType`

 The `massMatType` field sets, for frame or truss elements, whether consistent or lumped mass matrix is used for the inertial term in dynamic analyses. The `massMatType` field should be set as a string variable: `'consistent'` or `'lumped'`,  and if it is not declared then by default the `'lumped'` mass matrix is set.

 ### `elements.elemTypeAero`
The field  `elementTypeAero` should contain first, a vector with the three coordinates of the aerodynamic chord vector. The system of coordinates considered for this is the local reference system at the undeformed configuration. Second, the number of Gauss integration points $numGauss$ and finally $computeAeroBool$ (which computes the tangent matrix of the aerodynamic force vector) as follows:
```math
[ vch_{t1} \,\, vch_{t2} \,\, vch_{t3} \,\,numGauss\, \,computeAeroBool ]
```
 ### `elements.aeroCoefs`

The `aeroCoefs`field is a column cell that sets the function names for the aerodynamic co-rotational frame element. The information is added into a cell of strings containing the drag, lift and torsional moment function names whose inputs are: (1) the relative angle of incidence and Reynolds number. If any of the coefficients is not considered then an empty `[]` should be added. The aeroCoefs field is: 

```math
\{ 'dragCoefFunction'; 'liftCoefFunction'; 'momentCoefFunction' \} ;
```

### `elements.elemCrossSecParams`

This is a cell structure with the information of the geometry of the element.

#### 1D elements

For `truss` or `frame` elements, this cell contains the cross-section properties:
```math
\{ crossSectionTypeString, \,\, crossSectionParam_{1}, \,\,\dots,\,\, crossSectionParam_{n}\}
```
with $n$ being the number of parameters of the cross section type, and `crossSectionTypeString` the type of cross section. The possible cross-section and its properties are:

 - `generic`  :general sections, where areas and inertias are provided as parameters according to the vector: $[A \,\, J \,\, I_{yy} \,\, I_{zz} \,\, I_{\rho}(1,1) \,\, I_{\rho}(2,2) \,\, I_{\rho}(3,3) ] $ where $A$ is the area, $I_{ii}$ is the second moment of inertia of the cross-section respect to $i$ direction, $J$ is the polar moment of inertia and $I_{\rho}$ is the inertia tensor.
 - `rectangle`: rectangular sections where thicknesses ``t_y`` and ``t_z`` are provided
 - `circle` : circular sections where diameter is provided.
 - `pipe` : circular hollow section where external and internal diameters are provided as first and second entries of the vector of elementCrossSecParams.

For `edge` elements the thickness is expected (for 2D load computations).

See the `crossSectionProps.m` function for more details.
#### 2D elements

For 2D elements such as `triangle` in this field a float number representing the thickness of the element is set.   

## The `boundaryConds` struct

### `boundaryConds.loadsCoordSys`

```math
[ f_x,  \, m_x, \, f_y, \, m_y, \, f_z, \, m_z ]
```
where $f_i$ are the components of forces and $m_i$ are the moments. Both forces or moments are considered per unit of length in the case of `truss`/`frame`/`edge` elements, or per unit of area in the case of `triangle`.

## The `initialConds` struct

The $\{i,1\}$ entry contains the vector with the MEBI (Material, Element, boundaryConds and initialConds) indexes and the nodes of the $i$-th element. The structure of the vector at each entry of the cell is:
```math
 [ materialInd, \, elementInd, \, boundaryCondInd, \, initialCondInd, \, node_1 \dots node_{n} ]
```
where the five indexes are natural numbers and $n$ is the number of nodes required by the type of element. If no property is assigned the $0$ index can be used, for instance, nodes used to introduced loads should be defined with `materialIndex = 0`.
