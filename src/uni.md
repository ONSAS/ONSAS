# Uniform curvature cantilever beam
---

In this tutorial, the Uniform curvature cantilever example and its resolution using ONSAS are described. The aim of this example is to validate the static co-rotational 3D beam implementation by comparing the results provided by ONSAS with the analytical solution.

The problem consists in a beam, with one free end submitted to a nodal moment $M$, and the other end constrained (welded), as it is shown in the figure.

Before defining the structs, the workspace is cleaned, the ONSAS directory is added to the path and scalar geometry and material parameters are defined.
```
close all, clear all ;
% add path
addpath( [ pwd '/../../src'] );
% material scalar parameters
E = 200e9 ;  nu = 0.3 ;
% geometrical scalar parameters
l = 10 ; ty = .1 ;  tz = .1 ;
```

## MEBI parameters
------------------

The modelling of the structure begins with the definition of the Material-Element-BoundaryConditions-InitialConditions (MEBI) parameters.
### materials
 Since the example contains only one rod the fields of the `materials` struct will have only one entry. Although, it is considered constitutive behavior according to the SaintVenantKirchhoff law:
```
materials.hyperElasModel  = { '1DrotEngStrain'} ;
materials.hyperElasParams = { [ E nu ] } ;
```

## elements

Two different types of elements are considered, node and beam. The nodes will be assigned in the first entry (index $1$) and the beam at the index $2$. The elemType field is then:
```
elements.elemType = { 'node','beam' } ;
```
 for the geometries, the node has not geometry to assign (empty array), and the truss elements will be set as a rectangular-cross section by ty and tz the dimensions on y and z direction, then the elemTypeGeometry field is:
```
Iy = ty*tz^3/12 ; Iz = tz*ty^3/12 ;
elements.elemTypeGeometry = { [], [2 ty tz ] };
elements.elemTypeParams = { [], 1 };
```

## boundaryConds

 The elements are submitted to two different BC settings. The nodes $A$ is completely fixed and the node $B$ is submitted by a nodal moment load. According to this, the $A$ has a constraint in displacement besides the node $B$ has an applied load. The load factor function of the moment is set so that the target load make the beam into a circle. The density is set to zero, then no inertial effects are considered.

```
finalTime = 1;
boundaryConds.loadCoordSys = { []        ; 'global'   } ;
boundaryConds.loadTimeFact = { []        ; @(t) E * Iy * 2 * pi / l /finalTime *t   } ;
boundaryConds.loadBaseVals = { []        ; [ 0 0 0 -1 0 0 ] } ;
boundaryConds.impoDispDofs = { [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] ; 1          } ;
boundaryConds.impoDispVals = { [ 0 0 0 ] ; 0          } ;
```


## initial Conditions
 homogeneous initial conditions are considered, then an empty struct is set:
```
initialConds                = struct() ;
```

## mesh parameters
 The mesh is parmetric according to the number of elements selected with ths variable:
```
numElements = 10 ;
```
The coordinates of the nodes of the mesh are given by the matrix:
```
mesh.nodesCoords = [ (0:(Nelem))' * l/numElements'* zeros(Nelem+1,2) ] ;
```
The connectivity is introduced using the _conecCell_. Each entry of the cell contains a vector with the four indexes of the MEBI parameters, followed by the indexes of the nodes of the element (node connectivity). For didactical purposes each element entry is commented. First the cell is initialized:
```
mesh.conecCell = { } ;
```
 then the first two nodes are defined, both with material zero (since nodes dont have material), the first element type (the first entry of the cells of the _elements_ struct), and the first entry of the cells of the boundary conditions struct. No non-homogeneous initial condition is considered (then zero is used) and finally the node is included.
```
mesh.conecCell{ 1, 1 } = [ 0 1 1 0  1   ] ;
```
 the following case only differs in the boundary condition
```
mesh.conecCell{ 3, 1 } = [ 0 1 2 0  2   ] ;
```
 the beam elements are formed by the first material, the second type of element, and no boundary conditions are applied to any element. Becouse of the parametric implmetetion depending on numElements variable an auxiliar matrix is defined:
```
auxiliarMatrixConec = [ (ones(numElements,1)*[ 1 2 0 0]) (1:(numElements))' (2:(numElements+1))' ] ;
```
 then the conection vectors are  added to the conCell array as follows:
```
for i:numElements
  mesh.conecCell{ end+1,1 } = auxiliarMatrixConec (i,:) ;
end
```

## analysisSettings
```
analysisSettings.methodName    = 'newtonRaphson' ;
analysisSettings.deltaT        = 0.1 ;
analysisSettings.finalTime     =   finalTime ;
analysisSettings.stopTolDeltau =   1e-6 ;
analysisSettings.stopTolForces =   1e-6 ;
analysisSettings.stopTolIts    =   10 ;
analysisSettings.finalTime     =   1 ;
```

## otherParams
```
otherParams.problemName = 'uniformCurvatureCantilever';
otherParams.plotParamsVector = [3] ;
otherParams.controlDofs = [Nelem+1  4 ] ;
```
## Analysis case 1: NR with Rotated Eng Strain
 In the first case ONSAS is run and the solution at the dof (angle of node B) of interest is stored:
```
[matUs, loadFactorsMat] = ONSAS( materials, elements, boundaryConds, initialConds, mesh, analysisSettings, otherParams ) ;
```
 the control dof to verificate the solution is the node angle B, this corresponds to the following dof number:
```
angleControlDof = (Nelem+1)*6 - 2;
controlDispsNREngRot =  -matUs(angleControlDof,:) ;
loadFactorsNREngRot  =  loadFactorsMat(:,2) ;
```
 and the analytical value of the load factors is computed
```
analyticLoadFactorsNREngRot = @(w) w * l / ( E * Iy ) ;

```
