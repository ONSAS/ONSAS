% Implementation of a triangular finite element with 6 dfos (3 translations and 3 rotations) per node for the analysis of linear elastic isotropic shells with constant thickness.
% The element is formed by the superposition of a plate element (DKT) and a plane stress element (CST) with
% with addition to artificial drilling (rotation about the axis normal to the element plane) stiffness.
