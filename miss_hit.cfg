# Style guide configuration for MISS_HIT
# Reference: https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit/style_checker.html

# Format check parameters:
# Maximum allowed length for a single line of code (in characters)
# Helps maintain code readability without unnecessary horizontal scrolling.
line_length: 200
# Number of spaces a single tab corresponds to
# Ensures consistent indentation throughout the codebase.
tab_width: 2
# Regular expression for function names
# Enforces CamelCase naming convention: each word starts with an uppercase letter, no underscores.
regex_function_name: "[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*"
# Regular expression for script file names
# Enforces CamelCase naming convention for file names: no spaces, starts with an uppercase letter.
regex_script_name: "[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*"
# Regular expression for parameter (variable) names
# Enforces snake_case naming for function parameters (unchanged for clarity and consistency).
regex_parameter_name: "[a-zA-Z]+(_[a-zA-Z]+)*"

# Metrics for code quality

# "cnest" (Control Nesting Depth): Maximum allowed nesting level of control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals)
# Helps reduce code complexity and improve maintainability.
metric "cnest": limit 6
# "file_length": Maximum allowed number of lines in a single file
# Keeps files manageable and easier to navigate.
metric "file_length": limit 1000
# "cyc" (Cyclomatic Complexity): Maximum allowed complexity of a single function
# A lower value ensures that functions remain simple and focused.
metric "cyc": limit 35
# "parameters": Maximum allowed number of parameters for a single function
# Encourages simpler function signatures and improves readability.
metric "parameters": limit 7
